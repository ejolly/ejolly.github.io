title: About Me
---

I'm a PhD candidate in the [Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Laboratory](http://cosanlab.com) at Dartmouth College working with [Luke Chang](http://lukejchang.com).  

At the moment I'm also a research intern in the [Computational Social Science Group](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/cssnyc/) at Microsoft Research working with [Duncan Watts](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/duncan/).

My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms and computations that humans employ when trying to connect with one another. In particular I'm interested in how people use their beliefs and predictive inferences about others' mental and emotional states to make social decisions and derive value from social experiences. 

I employ a diverse set of scientific methods, combining approaches from behavioral economics, computational modeling, social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. I also use a wide range of tools for study design and analysis such as [online real-time interactive experiments](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) and [functional neuroimaging](http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 

Previously I received a BA from the University of Rochester where I studied the origins of conceptual knowledge at the [Concepts, Actions, and Objects Lab](http://caoslab.bcs.rochester.edu) with Jessica Cantlon and Brad Mahon. Subsequently I worked as a lab manager at the [Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~scanlab/) with Jason Mitchell and Joe Moran.


In my little spare time I write and play music with several different bands including my [sister](https://soundcloud.com/thosesiblings). I probably waste too much time reading about statistics, especially [mixed effects modeling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) and [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/.). I'm also excited about using [modern web-based technologies](https://www.meteor.com/) and studying [social media](http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/~ejolly/temp/visualizingTwitter.html) to help understand real-world human behavior.
