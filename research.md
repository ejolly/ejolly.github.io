My broad research interests fall into three levels of analysis: a) understanding the psychological and neural processes employed by an individual when connecting with others, b) the judgments and emotions involved during social interactions and shared-decision making, c) the dynamics of group norm development and information propagation in large networks of people.  

Probably most fun for me (because I'm easily distracted by [shiny geeky things]({{site.url}}/software)) is combining a diverse set of methodological approaches to draw new insights from these research areas. This includes combining methods from behavioral economics, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling.

Specifically, [computational modeling](https://github.com/ljchang/CosanlabToolbox) can be a useful tool for understanding how people derive value from social situations, use their emotions to inform their decisions, and integrate their feelings about others' welfare into their choices. [Machine-learning](https://github.com/ljchang/nltools) in conjunction with [functional brain-imaging](http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is a way to take this further and try to make predictions about behavior and understand how psychological processes are implemented or represented in the brain. Finally, [online real-time interactive group experiments](https://github.com/cosanlab/PGG_meteor) make it possible to study how information spreads within larger social groups and how group behavior evolves over time.
