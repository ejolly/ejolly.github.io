My broad research interests fall into three levels of analysis: a) understanding the psychological and neural processes employed by an individual when connecting with others, b) the judgments and emotions involved during social interactions and shared-decision making, c) the dynamics of group norm development and information propagation in large networks of people.  

Probably most fun for me (because I'm easily distracted by shiny geeky things) is combining a diverse set of methodological approaches to draw new insights from these research areas. This includes combining methods from behavioral economics, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling.

Specifically, [computational modeling](https://github.com/ljchang/CosanlabToolbox) can be a useful tool for understanding how people derive value from social situations, use their emotions to inform their decisions, and integrate their feelings about others' welfare into their choices. [Machine-learning](https://github.com/ljchang/nltools) in conjunction with [functional brain-imaging](http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is a way to take this further and try to make predictions about behavior and understand how psychological processes are implemented or represented in the brain. Finally, [online real-time interactive group experiments](https://github.com/cosanlab/PGG_meteor) make it possible to study how information spreads within larger social groups and how group behavior evolves over time.

In addition to my primary research areas I also routinely develop, contribute to, and maintain several software projects, often revolving around my lab work or some side project. Currently these include:

**Nltools**

>A python package for analyzing brain-imaging data, though also usable for other types of data. Makes data manipulation, model building and fitting quite simple.      
>[Github](https://github.com/ljchang/nltools) |  [Docs](http://neurolearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**Cosan Lab Analysis Containers**

>A python-based analysis environment with multiple tools prebuilt for brain-imaging data analysis.  
>Docker: [Github](https://github.com/cosanlab/cosanToolsDocker) | [Docker-Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ejolly/cosantoolsdocker/)  
>Singularity: [Github](https://github.com/cosanlab/cosanToolsSingularity) | [Singularity-Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/108/)

**Pymer4**

>A python wrapper around the [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) mixed-modeling [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package. Makes it easy to use lme4 from within python data analysis libraries like [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
