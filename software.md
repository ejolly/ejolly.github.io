In addition to my primary research I also routinely develop, contribute to, and maintain several software projects, often revolving around my lab work or some side project. Currently these include:

**Nltools**

>A python package for analyzing brain-imaging data, though also usable for other types of data. Makes data manipulation, model building and fitting quite simple. Builds upon several popular python libraries for [brain-imaging analysis](http://nipy.org/) and [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) more generally.         
>[Github](https://github.com/ljchang/nltools) |  [Docs](http://neurolearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**Cosan Lab Analysis Containers**

>A brain-imaging data analysis environment prebuilt with several neuroimaging specific programs, alongside the [scientific python stack](https://www.scipy.org/about.html).  
>Docker: [Github](https://github.com/cosanlab/cosanToolsDocker) | [Docker-Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ejolly/cosantoolsdocker/)  
>Singularity: [Github](https://github.com/cosanlab/cosanToolsSingularity) | [Singularity-Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/108/)

**Pymer4**

>A python wrapper around the [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) mixed-modeling [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package. Makes it easy to use lme4 from within python and in conjunction with data analysis libraries like [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
