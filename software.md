**nltools**

>A Python package for analyzing brain-imaging data, though also usable for other types of data. Makes data manipulation, model building and fitting quite simple. Builds upon several popular python libraries for [brain-imaging analysis](http://nipy.org/) and [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) more generally.

**pymer4**

>A Python package for analyzing and simulating standard and multi-level regression data. Performs standard and robust regression, but also features a wrapper around the [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) mixed-modeling [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package. Makes it much easier to use lme4 from within python and in conjunction with data analysis libraries like [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

**pyfit**

>A high-level computational model-fitting toolbox in Python. Particularly useful for easily fitting separate models to different individuals/groups/clusters and interfacing with data analysis libraries like  [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

**Cosan Lab analysis containers**

>"Containerized" brain-imaging data-analysis environments prebuilt with several neuroimaging specific programs, alongside the [scientific python stack](https://www.scipy.org/about.html). Skips the need to manually go through tedious software installation steps and makes it easier to conduct [reproducible research](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v18/n2/full/nrn.2016.167.html). The containers are currently used by the [Cosan Lab](http://cosanlab.com/).
