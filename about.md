        <p>I'm currently a PhD candidate in the <a class="nounderline" href="http://cosanlab.com">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Laboratory</a> at Dartmouth college working with <a class="nounderline" href="http://lukejchang.com">Luke Chang</a>. My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms and computations that humans employ when trying to connect with one another.

<p>Previously I received a BA from the University of Rochester where I studied the origins of conceptual knowledge at the <a href="http://caoslab.bcs.rochester.edu" class="nounderline">Concepts, Actions, and Objects Lab</a> with Jessica Cantlon and Brad Mahon. Subsequently I worked as a lab manager at the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~scanlab/" class="nounderline">Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab</a> with Jason Mitchell and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-moran-32261662/" class="nounderline">Joe Moran.</a></p>

<p>I was originally born in New Delhi, India but have lived and grown up outside New York City since I was about three years old. I have one younger <a href="http://www.jihii.com/" class="nounderline">sister</a> who works as a <a href="http://www.newsdeeply.com/" class="nounderline">kick-ass journalist</a>.</p>And yup that's a structural scan of my brain; I used to make this <a href="https://twitter.com/Eshjolly/status/819221466650705920" class="nounderline">3d print</a>.
