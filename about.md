        <p>I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher in the <a class="nounderline" href="http://cosanlab.com">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Laboratory</a> at Dartmouth college working with <a class="nounderline" href="http://lukejchang.com">Luke Chang</a> where I also competed my PhD. My research broadly focuses on how humans form psychological impressions and construct neural representations of other people and ultimately how these representations change as they are transmitted between individuals.

<p class="about-para">Previously I received a BA from the University of Rochester where I studied the origins of conceptual knowledge at the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/caoslab/" class="nounderline">Concepts, Actions, and Objects Lab</a> with Jessica Cantlon and Brad Mahon. Subsequently I worked as a lab manager at the <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~scanlab/" class="nounderline">Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab</a> with Jason Mitchell and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-moran-32261662/" class="nounderline">Joe Moran.</a> I was originally born in New Delhi, India but have lived and grown up outside New York City since I was about three years old, but currently reside in Vermont. I have one younger <a href="http://www.jihiijolly.com/" class="nounderline">sister</a> who works as a kick-ass journalist.</p>

<p class="about-para">In addition to my academic work, I believe strongly in developing and contributing to open-source software tools to increase the accessibility of and better democratize scientific research. Checkout my <a class="nounderline" href="{{site.url}}/sofware">software</a> for more info. I also volunteer with several community and outreach efforts such as: improving civic-tech with <a class="nounderline" href="https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigades/Code-for-Upper-Valley/">Code4UV</a> a local brigade of the larger <a class="nounderline" href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>; and serving as the VP of client-outreach for the <a class="nounderline" href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dgcg/">Dartmouth Graduate Consulting Group</a> to help local small businesses and non-profits identify and solve problems for positive change.</p>

<p class="about-para">And yup that's a structural scan of my brain; I used to make this <a href="https://twitter.com/Eshjolly/status/819221466650705920" class="nounderline">3d print</a>.</p>
