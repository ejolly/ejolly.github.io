I recently attended [Neurohackweek](https://neurohackweek.github.io/nhw2016/), a week-long workshop + hackathon focusing on technologies relevant to brain imaging. It was a totally amazing experience. Despite initially feeling like I was way in over-my-head, I learned a ton of new things and (hopefully) helped others do the same. I'd highly recommend other folks check it out if they have the opportunity.  

I worked as part of a multi-group project that (broadly speaking) was trying  to integrate a fast and easy way to compare different machine-learning and data QA algorithms with a powerful cloud computing framework. My specific role was part of the algorithm development ("black box") team to wrap some of the awesome functionality from existing [machine-learning tools in python](http://scikit-learn.org/) into simple, light-weight, intelligent, but configurable command-line [analysis programs](https://github.com/neurohackweek/kids/tree/master/ML). That way, these programs could be rapidly slotted into a larger computing framework with minimal interaction from a user.

Here's a really quick talk I gave on the final day of the week, briefly explaining what we managed to accomplish:
