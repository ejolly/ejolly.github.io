description: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
---

This year I helped organize the first annual [Brainhack](https://dartmouthbrainhack.github.io/) at Dartmouth College. It was our satellite hackathon, which was part of the larger annual [Brainhack Global](http://events.brainhack.org/global2017/). Overall we received a lot of positive feedback and attendees said they learned a ton.

In addition to being an organizer I gave a brief introduction to [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) as an environment for interactive data analysis (and much more). There are already a ton of great resources explaining notebook features in detail, so for this talk I wanted to provide a brief overview and discuss how I most often use notebooks: as a highly customizable, one-stop, shareable, multi-language, analysis environment.  
*Bonus: The slides themselves are generated using a Jupyter Notebook*
